# kitsune-settings

A collection of settings I like to have in my home directory

# Installation

To install the settings to your home directory, just clone the repository and run `install` from the cloned directory.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kitsune7/kitsune-settings.git
cd ./kitsune-settings
./install
```

# Install Script Options

The following options are available for `install`:

__-h__&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shows usage string.

__-f__&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does not prompt you when overwriting existing files. Note: This may overwrite previous settings you had in your home directory. Use with discretion.

__-q__&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hides most output from the program. To keep all output hidden, it is recommended to use this in conjunction with -f.
